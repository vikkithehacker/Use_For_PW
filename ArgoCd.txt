What Is Argo CD?
Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Why Argo CD?¶
Application definitions, configurations, and environments should be declarative and version controlled. 
Application deployment and lifecycle management should be automated, auditable, and easy to understand.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


How it works¶
Argo CD follows the GitOps pattern of using Git repositories as the source of truth for defining the desired application state.
Kubernetes manifests can be specified in several ways:

kustomize applications-
helm charts-
jsonnet files-
Plain directory of YAML/json manifests-
Any custom config management tool configured as a config management plugin-

Argo CD automates the deployment of the desired application states in the specified target environments.
Application deployments can track updates to branches, tags, or pinned to a specific version of manifests at a Git commit.

ArgoCD Architectural Overview-
Argo CD is implemented as a kubernetes controller which continuously monitors running applications and compares the current,live state against the desired target state. 
A deployed application whose live state deviates from the target state is considered OutOfSync. 
Argo CD reports & visualizes the differences, while providing facilities to automatically or manually sync the live state back to the desired target state. 
Any modifications made to the desired target state in the Git repo can be automatically applied and reflected in the specified target environments.

ArgoCD Components-

1) API Server¶
The API server is a gRPC/REST server which exposes the API consumed by the Web UI, CLI, and CI/CD systems. 
It has the following responsibilities:

>application management and status reporting
>invoking of application operations (e.g. sync, rollback, user-defined actions)
>repository and cluster credential management (stored as K8s secrets)
>authentication and auth delegation to external identity providers
>RBAC enforcement
>listener/forwarder for Git webhook events

2) Repository Server¶
The repository server is an internal service which maintains a local cache of the Git repository holding the application manifests. 
It is responsible for generating and returning the Kubernetes manifests when provided the following inputs:

>repository URL
>revision (commit, tag, branch)
>application path
>template specific settings: parameters, helm values.yaml

3) Application Controller¶
The application controller is a Kubernetes controller which continuously monitors running applications and compares the current, 
live state against the desired target state (as specified in the repo). It detects OutOfSync application state and optionally takes corrective action. 
It is responsible for invoking any user-defined hooks for lifecycle events (PreSync, Sync, PostSync).
